You are given a "secret" string, and you are given a "guess"
string. Both strings have exactly 5 characters.

Assume that each letter occurs at most one time in the secret string and the
guess string.

Some of the letters in the guess string occur in the same position as
the secret string. Call the number of such letters as I.

Some other letters in the guess string occur in the secret string, but
in some other position. Call the number of such letters as J.

You have to output
I#J

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int I=0;
  int J=0;
  char secret[6];
  char guess[6];
  scanf("%s",secret);
  scanf("%s",guess);

  for(int i=0;i<5;i++)
  {
    if(secret[i]==guess[i])
      I++;
  
  }
  for(int i=0;i<5;i++)
  {
    if(guess[i]!=secret[i])
    {
     	for(int j=0;j<5;j++)
        {
          if(guess[i]==secret[j])
            J++;
        }
    }
   
  }
  printf("%d#%d",I,J);
  return 0;
}
